    <h1>Test</h1>


<p>Balm: Soothes and calms nerves and emotions.</p>

<p>Constricting: Impairing or immobilizing the wearer by pinning limbs against body.</p>

<p>Cowing: Causes the listed type of creatures to submit more easily to the wearer&#39;s wishes by intimidation.</p>

<p>Fortified: Acts as armor or aegis of the specified type.</p>

<p>Gallium: Soft, tough, silvery liquid metal weave that hardens in the cold.</p>

<p>Hesychastic: Dampens or quietens sounds underneath items with this quality.</p>

<p>Impermeable: Liquid cannot pass through it.</p>

<p>Lithe: So unencumbering that is does not require an equipment slot.</p>

<p>Living: Repairs itself under certain conditions, like exposure to sunshine or water. If no speed is given, it does it slowly.</p>

<p>Magic: Cannot be harmed by non-magical means.</p>

<p>Obfuscate: Good at hiding what&#39;s underneath, so long as it&#39;s fully covered.</p>

<p>Profane: Unhallowed, reeking of sin to those attuned to such scents, like common animals and young children.</p>

<p>Repellent: Entities of the specified nature do not willingly approach closer than a short distance, and if they&#39;re reasonably light gravity can&#39;t generally make them either.</p>

<p>Rigidulous: Only moves with force, not with momentum.</p>

<p>Sapiential: Said to provide wisdom. Third-eye stimulating.</p>

<p>Sharded : Made of painstakingly connected or mounted hard pieces, like steel, mother of pearl, or obsidian. Functions as the armor indicated, but only takes half the usual slots, and looks killer.</p>

<p>Uniform: Forms or is part of a uniform, a recognizable outfit of a defined group, for good or ill.</p>
