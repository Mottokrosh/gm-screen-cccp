    <h1>Capes and Cloaks and Cowls and a Park—Digital GM Screen</h1>


<p><strong>Balm:</strong> Soothes and calms nerves and emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Constricting:</strong> Impairing or immobilizing the wearer by pinning limbs against body.</p>

<p><strong>Cowing:</strong> Causes the listed type of creatures to submit more easily to the wearer&#39;s wishes by intimidation.</p>

<p><strong>Fortified:</strong> Acts as armor or aegis of the specified type.</p>

<p><strong>Gallium:</strong> Soft, tough, silvery liquid metal weave that hardens in the cold.</p>

<p><strong>Hesychastic:</strong> Dampens or quietens sounds underneath items with this quality.</p>

<p><strong>Impermeable:</strong> Liquid cannot pass through it.</p>

<p><strong>Lithe:</strong> So unencumbering that is does not require an equipment slot.</p>

<p><strong>Living:</strong> Repairs itself under certain conditions, like exposure to sunshine or water. If no speed is given, it does it slowly.</p>

<p><strong>Magic:</strong> Cannot be harmed by non-magical means.</p>

<p><strong>Obfuscate:</strong> Good at hiding what&#39;s underneath, so long as it&#39;s fully covered.</p>

<p><strong>Profane:</strong> Unhallowed, reeking of sin to those attuned to such scents, like common animals and young children.</p>

<p><strong>Repellent:</strong> Entities of the specified nature do not willingly approach closer than a short distance, and if they&#39;re reasonably light gravity can&#39;t generally make them either.</p>

<p><strong>Rigidulous:</strong> Only moves with force, not with momentum.</p>

<p><strong>Sapiential:</strong> Said to provide wisdom. Third-eye stimulating.</p>

<p><strong>Sharded :</strong> Made of painstakingly connected or mounted hard pieces, like steel, mother of pearl, or obsidian. Functions as the armor indicated, but only takes half the usual slots, and looks killer.</p>

<p><strong>Uniform:</strong> Forms or is part of a uniform, a recognizable outfit of a defined group, for good or ill.</p>
